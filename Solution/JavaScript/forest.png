Simultaneously, a sleek, dark-grey creature named Drako is executing a mesmerizing twirl, which altogether maintains the balance of the forest. Sequence 2 follows the same pattern. For Sequence 3, both Lox and Drako are performing simultaneous spins, radiating an aura of harmony which keeps the forest in balance.
